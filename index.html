                    Enoying the 360 degree views year-round are radio communication towers.
                    Over a dozen different agencies use this site to relay communications. From the Siuslaw National Forest
                    and the Bonneville Power Anministration (BPA) who must stay in contact with field crews,
                    to emergency response systems including state police and fire departments, the site's location is critical.

                    "From the Siuslaw’s Corvallis headquarters, a radio signal is beamed to the mountaintop and fans out through
                    a system of 17 repeaters to cover the entire 633,000-acre forest, which stretches along the coast from Tillamook
                    to Coos Bay and inland to Marys Peak. The system provides two-way voice communications for employees in the
                    field through 200 vehicle-mounted radios and 600 handheld units, even in remote areas with no cellphone service."

                    is generally mixed between wanting the site to continue being used as it currently is, and
                    wanting the site altered or removed altogether.

                <h2>Alternative Locations</h2>
                <p>
                    To be a viable alternative any new site must provide coverage similar to the current site.
                    This is to ensure that the many agencies who rely on the single site as a critical component of
                    their communications network will not be forced to add many new towers to make up for the loss.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are four options that could be considered as starting points for an alternative site investigation.
                    Each one is away from the summit, yet still prominent enough to offer a large amount of coverage.
                    The four sites are:
                </p>
                <p>West Point</p>
                <p>FAA</p>

                <h2>West Point</h2>
                <p>
                    A local nonprofit citizens group, Mary’s Peak Alliance Committee,has proposed moving the communications
                    equipment to West Point—a communications site 1 mile west of the Mary’s Peak that is operated and maintained by the City of Corvallis.

            <section data-scene="scene6">

                <p>
                    In the same region as West Point there is another communications site owned and operated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
                    Both the West Point and FAA site have the benefit of power and some infrastructure already in place
                    negating the need for additional spending.

                <p>
                    The second highest point in the area is a hill opposite of the mountain's summit, called Opposite Hill
                    here.

                    Bill Gallantly, a retired engineer and Mary’s Peak Alliance member, has his own proposal.
                    It would involve burying the building structures in a concrete bunker on the east slope, and moving
                    the towers 100 yards east of their current location. This would allow the towers to still utilize the
                    high vantage point while clearing the bald summit of any human obstruction.

                <h2>Comparisons</h2>
                <p>
                    Each of these four sites have costs and benefits associated with them. Determining which one is the
                    best alternative to the current site requires weighting these costs and benefits against each other.
                    One cost, however, may outweigh all others; coverage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Without adequate coverage agencies may need to add more communications sites to make up the difference.
                    To quantifiably determine the best of these four alternative sites a viewshed analysis can be run using GIS.

                <h2>How viewshed analysis works</h2>
                <p>
                    Viewshed analysis in GIS is the determination of line-of-site visibility from one geographic point to another.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The computation for a viewshed is the process of considering the elevation of all data cells between
                    two points and determining if there are any with a high enough elevation value to impede line-of-sight.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is a raster dataset that holds location and elevation data for each cell.
                    It can be derived by methods of photogrammetry, interpolation of contours, or by LiDAR.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this analysis an 10 meter resolution NED (National Elevation Dataset) DEM from the USGS was used.
                    This particular DEM was created by photogrammetric methods.

            <section data-scene="scene16">
                <h2>Solution:</h2>
                <h2>Use a combination of sites</h2>
                <p>
                    A former Forest Service employee who ran communications for the Forest
                    Service for 20 years said locating the towers away from the equipment that powers them "would not be a major issue."
                </p>
                <p>
                    By using more than one of the four alternative sites a cumulative viewshed may be able to provide
                    similar coverage to the current site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are 4 combinations that would provide visibility on both sides of Mary's Peak:
                </p>
                <p>FAA + Opposite Hill</p>
                <p>FAA + Mary's Peak east</p>
                <p>West Point + Opposite Hill</p>
                <p>West Point + Mary's Peak east</p>
                <h2>Losses and Gaines</h2>
                <p>
                    Each combination will have some visibility lost and some visibility gained when compared with the current site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To quantifiably determine which alternative site combination is best, the number of visible cells lost was subtracted
                    from the number of visible cells gained to produce a number that represent the net visibility gain of each combination.

                <p>
                    Using the results of this viewshed analysis of Mary’s Peak, the WestPoint+MP_west option is the best
                    combination of alternative sites among those surveyed. Not only did it have the highest net gain in
                    visibility, the cells not visible in comparison with the current site had a high degree of dispersion
                    with no dead zones, as opposed to the FAA+MP_west option.
